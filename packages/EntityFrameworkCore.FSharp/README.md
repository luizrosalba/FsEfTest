# EFCore.FSharp

Add F# design time support to EF Core.

For a basic introduction to running code-first migrations, please see the [getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.

## Builds

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fefcore%2FEFCore.FSharp%2Fbadge&style=for-the-badge)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/efcore/EFCore.FSharp/goto)

## NuGet 

Package | Stable | Prerelease
--- | --- | ---
EFCore.FSharp | [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/EntityFrameworkCore.FSharp)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.FSharp/) | [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/EntityFrameworkCore.FSharp?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.FSharp/)

## Usage

Install the package from NuGet and follow our [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) guide or our full documentation at [https://efcore.github.io/EFCore.FSharp](https://efcore.github.io/EFCore.FSharp)

Currently created migrations must be manually added to your solution in the correct order. Although migrations are created with sequential file names so a glob can also be used

```xml
<Compile Include="Migrations/*.fs" />
```

### Building

```sh
> build.cmd <optional buildtarget> // on windows
$ ./build.sh  <optional buildtarget>// on unix
```

After building the solution, it will create a NuGet package in the `dist` folder.
This can then be referenced as usual.


### Developing

Make sure the following **requirements** are installed on your system:

- [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 5.0 or higher

or

- [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

### Environment Variables

- `CONFIGURATION` will set the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x#options) of the dotnet commands.  If not set, it will default to Release.
  - `CONFIGURATION=Debug ./build.sh` will result in `-c` additions to commands such as in `dotnet build -c Debug`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used to upload release notes and Nuget packages to GitHub.
  - Be sure to set this before releasing
- `DISABLE_COVERAGE` Will disable running code coverage metrics.  AltCover can have [severe performance degradation](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/issues/57) so it's worth disabling when looking to do a quicker feedback loop.
  - `DISABLE_COVERAGE=1 ./build.sh`

### Build Targets

- `Clean` - Cleans artifact and temp directories.
- `DotnetRestore` - Runs [dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019).
- [`DotnetBuild`](#Building) - Runs [dotnet build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019).
- `DotnetTest` - Runs [dotnet test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test?tabs=netcore21) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019).
- `GenerateCoverageReport` - Code coverage is run during `DotnetTest` and this generates a report via [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator).
- `WatchTests` - Runs [dotnet watch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/dotnet-watch?view=aspnetcore-3.0) with the test projects. Useful for rapid feedback loops.
- `GenerateAssemblyInfo` - Generates [AssemblyInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.applicationservices.assemblyinfo?view=netframework-4.8) for libraries.
- `DotnetPack` - Runs [dotnet pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-pack). This includes running [Source Link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink).
- `SourceLinkTest` - Runs a Source Link test tool to verify Source Links were properly generated.
- `PublishToNuGet` - Publishes the NuGet packages generated in `DotnetPack` to NuGet via [paket push](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-push.html).
- `GitRelease` - Creates a commit message with the [Release Notes](https://fake.build/apidocs/v5/fake-core-releasenotes.html) and a git tag via the version in the `Release Notes`.
- `GitHubRelease` - Publishes a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) with the Release Notes and any NuGet packages.
- `FormatCode` - Runs [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) on the solution file.
- `BuildDocs` - Generates Documentation from `docsSrc` and the [XML Documentation Comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/) from your libraries in `src`.
- `WatchDocs` - Generates documentation and starts a webserver locally.  It will rebuild and hot reload if it detects any changes made to `docsSrc` files, libraries in `src`, or the `docsTool` itself.
